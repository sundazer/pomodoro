Yet another Pomodoro timer
---

Pomodoro technique is simple. Define a task you want to get done in the next 25 minutes,
start the timer and do your work. After 25 minutes has passed, an alarm will ring and
you can take a 5 minute break. Repeat from beginning. Every fourth break should be a bit
longer, 15 minutes.
